This application allows users to discover movies through the app, and it enables features to save movies into two different lists; favourite movie list and wish movie list. Because of this application, users can discover movies with detailed information such as the release date of the movie and the average voting of a movie.  

This application was build using Flutter, and for the database, it uses the firebase firestore database. Also, for the authentication, we used firebase authentication for the PopCorn mobile application.
